Ã†gir Cooperative Operations Manual
==================================

This project contains the Aegir Cooperative's Operation Manual. It uses mkdocs to build a local docs site. To get started using or contributing to this manual:

    $ brew install python;               # For OSX users only
    $ sudo aptitude install python-pip   # For Debian/Ubuntu users only
    $ pip install mkdocs
    $ git clone git@gitlab.com/AegirCoop/ops.git aegir-coop-ops
    $ cd aegir-coop-ops
    $ mkdocs serve

Your local Ops Manual site should now be available for browsing: http://127.0.0.1:8000/. MkDocs support live-update, so any changes you make will be immediately available on the local site.

Since this is a shared/distributed document, you'll want to both `git pull` and commit/push regularly so that we can all keep up-to-date with changes.
