Infrastructure
==============


Omega8cc
--------

Omega8cc currently hosts a server for the Aegir project where we host:

* Debian repos  (To be replaced by http://openbuildservice.org)
* Jenkins   (To be replaced by TravisCI & GitlabCI)


Linode
------

The Co-op has an Aegir server on Linode, where we host our web sites. The credentials for the account are in LastPass. It is managed via Ansible using the code in https://github.com/AegirCoop/infrastructure. Specifics are documented inline with the Ansible code.


Amazon Web Services
-------------------

TODO: set up an account so that we can use (among other things) S3 buckets if/when needed.
