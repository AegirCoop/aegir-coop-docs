Ã†gir Cooperative Service Offerings
==================================

The Co-op's services currently fall under four categories:

* Aegir "vendor" [Support](services/support.md) provides the confidence that our experts will be available to help.
* [Training](services/training.md) further builds your team's internal capacity.
* A number of regular, discrete tasks are offered as [Managed Services](services/managed.md).
* When your needs extend beyond any of the above, [Consulting](services/consulting.md) is available from the same team that maintains Aegir core and a significant number of contributed modules.


Excluded Services
-----------------

We have specifically decided **not** to provide Aegir hosting services. Our reasoning here is that we want to help to build a thriving eco-system for Aegir. By providing hosting services, we would be competing against other participants in the eco-system, rather than supporting them.
