Rate Card
=========

Title | Hourly rate
----- | -----------
[Aegir Architect](../../roles#architect) | $150-200/hr
[Aegir Developer](../../roles#developer) | $125-175/hr
[Aegir Consultant](../../roles#consultant) | $100-150/hr

While we specilize in Aegir, we also extensive experience and expertise in all aspects of Drupal, CiviCRM and systems administration, consulting, development and architecture.

Our hourly rate ranges are based on the experience of the individual team member, as well as the nature of the work involved, among other things. Factors that we consider to push it towards the top of the range include pressing time-frames and requiring travel.

On the other hand, if the work entailed will likely result in upstream improvements, such as new features or bugfixes in Aegir or other components, we'll accept a lower rate. In addition, we can offer solidarity discounts to non-profits and fellow cooperatives.
