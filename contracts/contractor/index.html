<p>The Contractor hereby represents and warrants to the Cooperative that it is not party to any written or oral agreement with any third party that would restrict its ability to enter into this Agreement or the Confidentiality and Proprietary Information Agreement or to perform the Contractor's obligations hereunder and that the Contractor will not, by providing services to the Cooperative, breach any non-disclosure, proprietary rights, non-competition, non-solicitation or other covenant in favor of any third party.</p>
<p>The Contractor hereby agrees that, during the term of this Agreement and for one (1) year following the termination hereof, the Contractor will not (i) recruit, attempt to recruit or directly or indirectly participate in the recruitment of any Cooperative employee or (ii) directly or indirectly solicit, attempt to solicit, canvass or interfere with any customer or supplier of the Cooperative in a manner that conflicts with or interferes in the business of the Cooperative as conducted with such customer or supplier.</p>

This Agreement may be amended only by mutual written agreement of the party.</p>
<h2 id="9-assignment">9. Assignment</h2>
<p>This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon each party’s successors and assigns. Neither party shall assign any right or obligation hereunder in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other party.</p>
