Commentary on Cooperative By-laws
=================================

Introduction
------------

If you were to ask about the main feature of a cooperative, you would likely be
told that it is an association of people where there is no boss... This is both
true and false. While a cooperative is a company run democratically by
theoretically equal members, we often forget that there are many types of
democracy: from direct democracy where everything is decided collectively, to
the other extreme of representative democracy, where most of the powers are
centralized with a manager and in which the members meet only once a year in a
general assembly. In between, we find different structures of division of
powers. The more numerous and complex the decisions, the clearer the division
of powers must be. Many decisions cannot be made arbitrarily by the leaders of
the cooperative; the members need to set rules to guide decisions regarding the
governance of the cooperative.

It is therefore essential that a set of regulations adopted by the General
Assembly guide managers in the management of the cooperative. In practice, the
General Assembly adopts internal by-laws at the founding of the cooperative and
it alone has the power to change them later. We advise you to take particular
care in drafting these by-laws and especially that all members fully understand
them, because they form the foundation on which the whole democratic edifice of
the cooperative is built. The internal by-laws must also be seen as a didactic
tool. It not only allows members to better understand certain characteristics
of their cooperative but can also be used to inform members of some of their
rights. It may therefore be appropriate to include some general information
that is not necessarily specific to the cooperative concerned. For example, the
acceptable delay for calling an annual general meeting after the end of the
fiscal year or the rules of convening an extraordinary general meeting.
Although these components are based on law, we recommend integrating them into
internal by-laws. This information may be useful for members who, for the most
part, will not be inclined to consult the law.

It is important to understand that the internal by-laws are a living document
that must adapt to the evolution of the cooperative. One can also add to it, as
necessary, other regulations or appendices such as a labor agreement,
disciplinary rules, a member of contract, etc. In most cases, the regulations
will be adapted and modified several times during the early years of the
cooperative. In its first version, the internal by-laws should therefore not be
too comprehensive and detailed, so as not to tie the hands of the directors and
management in unexpected situations. These are often the experiences that will
help to identify additional items that should be incorporated into the by-laws.
While detailed regulations give more guidance to leaders and managers, they
also limit their discretion to act as appropriate. In the event that an item of
the by-laws prevents the board or a director from properly managing a situation,
a General Assembly should be convened and amendments should be proposed to the
regulation. It is therefore up to the General Assembly to determine the level
of autonomy that it wants to grant to its officers and managers.

Some elements of the internal by-laws are immutable because they must correspond
to the law of cooperatives, while others are determined by the members. In
drafting the by-laws, it is essential to always refer to the law of cooperatives
because it sets the minimum basis of internal by-laws. Any article, provided it
does not contradict any law and does not infringe rights protected by law, can
be integrated into the by-laws. We suggest consulting a specialist to advise on
the nuances of such documents. The attached framework includes only recognized
models of by-laws. Cooperatives do not have to be limited to these models, but
it should be useful when drafting a first revision of the by-laws.

Requirements of the Law on Cooperatives
---------------------------------------

1. The items marked with an asterisk (\*) must be adopted by the General
   Assembly and entered into the by-laws to apply.
2. Articles marked by two asterisks (\*\*) correspond to articles of law. They
   are therefore included in the by-laws for informational purposes only.

Commentary Structure
--------------------

Each by-law has a corresponding commentary page. Each chapter and article of
the by-laws is linked to its matching section in the commentary. These are
marked with a question mark icon ([](){: .fa .fa-question-circle}). Likewise,
each section in the commentary is linked back to its matching chapter or
article with a bookmark icon ([](){: .fa .fa-bookmark}).
