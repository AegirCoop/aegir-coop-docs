             belong;

|2. |Members from each group are entitled to nominate as  |
|   |many candidates as they wish                         |
|3. |As soon as they are nominated, the chairperson makes |
|   |sure that each candidate accepts the nomination. Any |
|   |refusal automatically eliminates that candidate;     |
|4. |Candidacy nominations for each group will only end   |
|   |after an  uncontested motion to do so has been duly  |
|   |accepted;                                            |

|   |candidates than positions available after the first  |
|   |elimination. If the number of candidates is equal to |
|   |the number of positions, the candidates will be      |
|   |elected by acclamation. If a group’s number of       |
|   |candidates is less than the number of available      |
|   |positions, the members in attendance will have to    |
|   |nominate a candidate from the group in question;     |
|6. |If an election is held, it will be by secret ballot. |
|   |A ballot is given to each member of a group who then |
|   |writes the names of the candidates s/he has selected.|
|   |The number of names on the ballot must correspond to |
|   |the number of positions available for the group in   |
|   |question.                                            |
|7. |The returning officers count the ballots and present |
|   |the results to the election president;               |
|8. |For each position with a vacancy, the president will |

|   |be elected, without revealing the number of votes    |
|   |obtained by each candidate;                          |
|9. |In the advent that a group’s last available position |
|   |results in a tied vote, another vote will be held    |
|   |with only the tied candidates in the running;        |
|10.|The director will be chosen by random draw, if there |
|   |still exists a tie after the second ballot;          |
|11.|If a minimum of one third of the members from the    |
|   |group in question that are present at the meeting    |
|   |request it, a recount will be held. In that event,   |
|   |the candidates involved will witness the recount;    |
|12.|The election secretary will destroy the ballots      |
|   |immediately after the vote;                          |
|13.|Any decision taken by the president in regards to the|
|   |procedures is binding on the assembly, unless the    |
|   |voters who are present reverse this decision by a    |
