Ægir Co-op Operations Manual
============================

This section is our Operations Manual. It describes how we do things here at the Ægir Co-op. It contains policies, procedures and other resources. It is intended to provide all members with background and guidance, thus allowing the confidence to independently operate within the cooperative.

It contains the following sub-sections:

* A [dashboard](operations/dashboard.md) to get an overview of current operational status and convenient links to other resources.
* A listing of the [services](operations/services.md) provided by the cooperative.
* A breakdown of the [roles and responsibilities](operations/roles.md) expected of members of the cooperative.
