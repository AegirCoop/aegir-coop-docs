CHANGES IN QUALIFYING SHARES
============================

ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF OPERATIONS
-------------------------------------

When the cooperative decided to make a change in the number of qualifying
shares depending on the nature of the operations which the member participates,
it replaces Article 2.1 of Regulation No. 1 by the following:


### 2.1 Qualifying shares

To become a member, a person must purchase the minimum amount of qualifying
shares corresponding to the nature of the operations which it is mainly
affected in the cooperative during a fiscal year.

Nature of operations | Minimum required shares
---- | -----
**[operations]** | $**[value]**
**[operations]** | $**[value]**
**[operations]** | $**[value]**
**[operations]** | $**[value]**
**[operations]** | $**[value]**

These shares may be fully subscribed for shares with a value of ten dollars
($10) each to be subscribed or due to a share of ten dollars ($10) and the
balance in preferred shares of a dollar ($1) each.
