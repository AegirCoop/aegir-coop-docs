Membership - Organizational
===========================

This section contains examples of forms and agreements related to
organizational membership within the coop. They do not form part of the
by-laws, as such, and are for the purposes of guidance and efficiency.

To become an organizational member of the Ægir Cooperative, as an authorized
representative of your organization, follow these steps:

1. Fill out and submit an [Application for Admission as an Auxiliary
Member](/by-laws/templates/membership/organization/application1.md).
2. The Co-op's Board of Directors will review the application. The Board may
request further documentation or interviews before deciding whether to approve
your organization's application. Once satisfied, the Board will pass a [Board
Resolution on Admission as an Auxiliary
Member](/by-laws/templates/membership/organization/admission1.md).
3. Once the trial period is complete, fill out and submit an [Application for
Admission as a Producer
Member](/by-laws/templates/membership/organization/application2.md).
4. The Co-op's Board of Directors will review the application and, assuming the
trial period was successful, will pass a [Board Resolution on Admission as a
Producer Member](/by-laws/templates/membership/organization/admission2.md).
5. Sign the [Member
Agreement](/by-laws/templates/membership/individual/agreement.md). Authorized
members of the Board of Directors will counter-sign the agreement.
Congratulations, your organization now a full member of the Ægir Cooperative!
