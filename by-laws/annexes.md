ANNEX III

Member Agreement


BETWEEN
_____________________________________
(name of member)
Hereinafter referred (e) "THE MEMBER"

AND

Producer cooperative company __________________ under the Cooperatives Act, domiciled in __________________________ represented by _____________________ _____________________ and which declare themselves duly authorized for the purposes hereof;
Hereinafter called "COOPERATIVE".

Whereas the member is committed to comply with the laws of the cooperative.
Whereas the law number 1 of the cooperative requires the signature of a member of the contract.


The parties hereto agree as follows:

1. The Member agrees to provide its services for one year to the cooperative when they are required and to respect the terms of delivery of the service established by the cooperative.
2. The cooperative is committed to offer contracts to its members in preference to any other person.
3. The Member may terminate this contract or its renewal by sending the secretary of the cooperative a written notice to this effect at least 30 days, which notice equivalent to a notice of resignation as a member. Without such notice, this Agreement or any renewal thereof, will be renewed automatically for a similar period.
4. The cooperative is released from its guarantee, if the member is expelled for unsatisfactory performance or if the member is unable for any reason whatsoever, to perform the work that the cooperative offers him.
5. Specialized job offer: (optional)
If the member has a specialization, it must be specified in this contract for these provisions to take effect.
The cooperative is committed to providing exclusive all specialist mandates this member.
The member agrees to give priority to specialized mandates issued by the cooperative to any other mandate from outside.
If more than one member has the same specialization, contracts are distributed according to other basic rules of labor allocation.
6. Member benefits (optional)
7. Responsibilities of the member (optional)
8. Confidentiality (optional)
The cooperative prohibits member conserve, transmit or use any confidential information, in whole or in part.
Any information on the administration, management or internal operation of the cooperative is considered confidential.
Any information acquired under a mandate granted to the cooperative is considered confidential.
9. Non-competition (optional)
It may be interesting, to protect both the cooperative and its members, to mark the rules of non-compete both with respect to customer and tools developed.

We integrated below against certain elements to be considered in the drafting of such a clause. Obviously, the non-compete clause must be written in the specific context of the company. To customize this item to your corporate context, we suggest you contact an attorney.

A distinction could be made between two situations:

Situation 1: The customer or tools owned by a natural or legal person before its accession to the cooperative

Situation 2: The customer or tools have been developed by the cooperative

Situation 1:

It could be decided that the customer is free to follow the outgoing member of the cooperative.

This element is interesting in the case of customers belonging to the member before it joined the cooperative. This reduces the risk to a member who has transferred a large customer to the cooperative.
Ongoing contracts could return to the cooperative.

Situation 2:

The cooperative may require the outgoing member a delay before it can solicit the customers of the cooperative.

This element could be applied to all the "new" customers of the cooperative. In this way, a member not having brought any customer to the cooperative, could, in case of starting the coop, solicit those customers before a certain deadline. This provides some stability to the cooperative event of the departure of its members.

Sample Clause:

The member also agrees to comply with this clause, effective the end of this Contract and during the __ years after the resignation or expulsion of a member.

Former member agrees not to offer services under the cooperative's service offer, any customer of the cooperative.

Former member agrees to decline all requests for service from a customer of the cooperative and to refer the customer to the cooperative.

If the cooperative loses a mandate in favor of a member or former member, the cooperative may demand compensation equal to the income from that client to the cooperative during the last year, or a minimum amount of $ ______.

This non-compete clause does not apply to customers who have a family relationship with the member or former member (immediate family member, a member of the spouse or immediate family member's spouse).
Any refusal by the member to accept a contract offer that will make the cooperative or abandonment of the contract, other than for medical reasons, will be a member for failure to perform its obligations to the cooperative within the meaning of paragraph 5 of Article 57 of the Cooperatives Act (RSQ, c. C-67.2).
