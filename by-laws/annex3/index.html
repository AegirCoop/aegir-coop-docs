<h2 id="member-agreement">Member Agreement</h2>
<p>BETWEEN</p>
<p><strong>[name of member]</strong></p>
<p>Hereinafter referred (e) "THE MEMBER"</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>Producer cooperative company <strong>[cooperative's name]</strong> under the Cooperatives
Act, domiciled in <strong>[city]</strong> represented by <strong>[name]</strong> and which declare
themselves duly authorized for the purposes hereof;</p>
<p>Hereinafter called "COOPERATIVE".</p>
<p>Whereas the member is committed to comply with the laws of the cooperative.</p>
<p>Whereas by-law number 1 of the cooperative requires the signature of a member
of this contract.</p>
<p>The parties hereto agree as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Member agrees to provide its services for one year to the cooperative
   when they are required and to respect the terms of delivery of the service
   established by the cooperative.</li>
<li>The cooperative is committed to offer contracts to its members in preference
   to any other person.</li>
<li>The Member may terminate this contract or its renewal by sending the
   secretary of the cooperative a written notice to this effect at least 30
   days, which notice equivalent to a notice of resignation as a member.
   Without such notice, this Agreement or any renewal thereof, will be renewed
   automatically for a similar period.</li>
<li>The cooperative is released from its guarantee, if the member is expelled
   for unsatisfactory performance or if the member is unable for any reason
   whatsoever, to perform the work that the cooperative offers him.</li>
<li>Specialized job offer: (optional)<ul>
<li>If the member has a specialization, it must be specified in this contract
  for these provisions to take effect.</li>
<li>The cooperative is committed to providing exclusive all specialist
  mandates this member.</li>
<li>The member agrees to give priority to specialized mandates issued by the
  cooperative to any other mandate from outside.</li>
<li>If more than one member has the same specialization, contracts are
  distributed according to other basic rules of labor allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Member benefits (optional)</li>
<li>Responsibilities of the member (optional)</li>
<li>Confidentiality (optional)</li>
<li>The cooperative prohibits member conserve, transmit or use any confidential
    information, in whole or in part.</li>
<li>Any information on the administration, management or internal operation of
    the cooperative is considered confidential.</li>
<li>Any information acquired under a mandate granted to the cooperative is
    considered confidential.</li>
<li>Non-competition (optional)</li>
</ol>
<p>It may be interesting, to protect both the cooperative and its members, to mark
the rules of non-compete both with respect to customer and tools developed.</p>
<p>We integrated below against certain elements to be considered in the drafting
of such a clause. Obviously, the non-compete clause must be written in the
specific context of the company. To customize this item to your corporate
context, we suggest you contact an attorney.</p>
<p>A distinction could be made between two situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Situation 1</em>: The customer or tools owned by a natural or legal person before
its accession to the cooperative</li>
<li><em>Situation 2</em>: The customer or tools have been developed by the cooperative</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Situation 1</strong>:</p>
<p>It could be decided that the customer is free to follow the outgoing member of
the cooperative.</p>
<p>This element is interesting in the case of customers belonging to the member
before it joined the cooperative. This reduces the risk to a member who has
transferred a large customer to the cooperative.</p>
<p>Ongoing contracts could return to the cooperative.</p>
<p><strong>Situation 2</strong>:</p>
<p>The cooperative may require the outgoing member a delay before it can solicit
the customers of the cooperative.</p>
<p>This element could be applied to all the "new" customers of the cooperative. In
this way, a member not having brought any customer to the cooperative, could,
in case of starting the coop, solicit those customers before a certain
deadline. This provides some stability to the cooperative event of the
departure of its members.</p>
<p>Sample Clause:</p>
<p>The member also agrees to comply with this clause, effective the end of this
Contract and during the __ years after the resignation or expulsion of a
member.</p>
<p>Former member agrees not to offer services under the cooperative's service
offer, any customer of the cooperative.</p>
<p>Former member agrees to decline all requests for service from a customer of the
cooperative and to refer the customer to the cooperative.</p>
<p>If the cooperative loses a mandate in favor of a member or former member, the
cooperative may demand compensation equal to the income from that client to the
cooperative during the last year, or a minimum amount of $ <strong>[value]</strong>.</p>
<p>This non-compete clause does not apply to customers who have a family
relationship with the member or former member (immediate family member, a
member of the spouse or immediate family member's spouse).</p>
<p>Any refusal by the member to accept a contract offer that will make the
cooperative or abandonment of the contract, other than for medical reasons,
will be a member for failure to perform its obligations to the cooperative
within the meaning of paragraph 5 of Article 57 of the Cooperatives Act (RSQ,
c. C-67.2).</p>
<p>Signed at <strong>[location]</strong> , on <strong>[date]</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>[member]</strong></p>
<p>Workers cooperative <strong>[cooperative's name]</strong></p>
<p>by : <strong>[name]</strong>
(duly authorized)</p>
<p>by : <strong>[name]</strong>
(duly authorized)</p>
