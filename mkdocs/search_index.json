            "text": "\ufeffGOVERNANCE\n\n\n[name of the cooperative]\n\n\nBY-LAW NUMBER 1\n\n\nChapter I:  Definitions \n\n\nArticle 1: Definitions \n\n\nBasic definitions help avoid confusion in the interpretation of articles of the\nby-laws. We recommend clearly defining the most frequently used terms and all\nterms in the by-laws whose meaning may vary from one context or person to\nanother.\n\n\nChapter II: Constitution \n\n\n(ref. Articles 7-20, 33-36, 222 and 223.1)\n\n\nArticles of Chapter II serve to inform. They are, however, included in the\narticles of incorporation of the cooperative.\n\n\nArticle 1: Incorporation of the cooperative \n\n\nDate and name of the cooperative and the law that governed its incorporation.\n\n\nArticle 2: Head office \n\n\nThe cooperative's head office address.\n\n\nArticle 3: Goals \n\n\nA producer cooperative must have an objective in its statutes to provide\nprofessional utility services to its members. Some cooperatives add other goals\n(for example, a community mission). They may also only register these\nadditional objectives in their by-laws. In fact, adding goals other than to\nprovide services in an application for cooperative status could complicate the\nanalysis and delay the acceptance.\n\n\nChapter III:  Social Capital \n\n\n(ref. Articles 37-49 of the Law)\n\n\nArticle 1: Qualifying shares \n\n\nNote: The number of qualifying shares may vary according to the nature of\noperations in which the member participates and by service volume that the\ncooperative is able to offer the member.\n\n\nThis is to determine the minimum level of financial commitment required to\nobtain membership status; that is to say the minimum amount to invest to become\na member. This financial involvement has two functions: to consolidate the\nmembership of the member in the cooperative (\"I've invested, I want it to\nwork\") and increase the company's capitalization and, in doing so, the\navailable liquidity the cooperative.\n\n\nQualifying shares may be of two types: only common shares or common shares and\npreferred shares. It is recommended that the minimum common shares ($10.00) and\nthe rest in preferred shares since the latter are eligible for significant tax\nadvantages and may bear interest (this interest should be limited), which is\nnot the case for the common shares.\n\n\nArticle 2: Payment terms \n\n\nQualifying shares may be paid in several ways: in full upon admission to\nmembership or fixed payments. Although full payment upon admission proves a\nreal commitment to the cooperative, requiring it could limit the admission of\ninteresting candidates who do not have the necessary funds.\n\n\nArticle 3: Reimbursement of shares \n\n\nReimbursement of shares is done upon departure of a member, but the board may\ndetermine priorities among the items listed in the law.\n\n\nArticle 4: Transfer of shares \n\n\nPreferred shares are transferable under the conditions set by the Board in\naccordance with Article 46 of the Law.\n\n\nArticle 5: Preferred shares* \n\n\nThe Board sets all rules on the issuance of preferred shares: interest rates,\nredemption terms, etc. The Cooperative Department provides a template for Board\nresolutions. This template is made based on the eligibility of preferred shares\nto the Cooperative Investment Plan (CIP), which provides a tax deduction of up\nto 125% to the cooperative members or workers who invest in preferred shares.\n\n\nArticle 6: Redemption, repayment or transfer of preferred shares \n\n\nSubject to the restrictions provided for in Article 38 of the law, the\npreferred shares are redeemable or redeemable under the conditions set by the\nBoard in accordance with Article 46 of the Law.\n\n\nThe Board may establish rules in this area. However, if members wish to use\nCIP, the board has to stick to the framework provided by the Cooperative\nDepartment, which sets the rules of redemption and repayment.\n\n\nThe date of 14 February 1997, cited in the law, refers to the old law which\nrequired that these rules are subject to a regulation adopted in General\nAssembly.\n\n\nThe Board may provide conditions of refund based on priority classes. It is\nthus necessary to distinguish the origin of the shares. Those from staff member\ninvestments could be repaid in priority, those from the payment of a dividend\ncould be reimbursed next.\n\n\nChapter IV: Members \n\n\n(ref. 51 Articles 60.2, 224.1 and 224.2 of the Act)\n\n\nArticle 1: Admission requirements \n\n\nThe law does not require the cooperative to implement a process of integration\nof members through the auxiliary member status. If the cooperative does not\ndetermine such a process, the producer is a full member as of the first day for\nwhich he fulfills a mandate for the cooperative (unless otherwise specified by\nthe producer).\n\n\nHowever, we strongly suggest setting up good integration processes, to ensure,\non the one hand, that new partners share the values and vision of the\norganization and on the other, that the person or entity understands the duties\nand responsibilities which become incumbent upon it as a member.\n\n\nTo formalize this new relationship between the producer and the cooperative, it\nis advisable to sign an application for admission as an auxiliary member -\nAPPENDIX 1.\n\n\nThis is to determine the time after which the board has enough information to\nproperly assess the admission of an auxiliary member as a permanent member. If\nyou want to keep a quality team, the selection of members should not be done\nlightly. However, excessively strict criteria involving a long and arduous\nselection process may result in alienating the person wishing to become a\nmember.\n\n\nWe must not forget that membership is an important factor of motivation. This\nmotivation is manifested in particular by an increased level of involvement in\nthe cooperative. So be careful not to unduly extend the evaluation period. This\ncould create an alienating effect in auxiliary members and a stagnant or even\ndecreasing involvement of these.\n\n\nHowever, if one is looking for a very specific profile (high specialization,\nspecific values, etc.), it may be appropriate to set a longer probationary\nperiod and stricter criteria to ensure the highest quality member possible. The\nmaximum period permitted by law is 12 months (art 193.4).\n\n\nIf a minimum test period is planned, this may allow in some cases to speed up\nthe admissions process as a member, especially if the person is already well\nknown to the team.\n\n\nIn any case, a first associative evaluation could be systemized after the\nminimum period. If the auxiliary member meets the criteria of the coop,\nadministrators could accept immediately. Otherwise, the auxiliary member is\ninvited to continue the probationary period to its maximum term.\n\n\nOther admission requirements may also be added: positive assessment of\nprofessional competence, level of voluntary involvement, etc. (Cooperatives\nAct, RSC., C. C-67.2., Article 3.1. C)\n\n\nThe cooperative may establish additional conditions for admission.\n\n\nArticle 2: Rights of auxiliary members \n\n\n(This section is optional.)\n\n\nThere is no requirement for a cooperative to convoke auxiliary members.\nHowever, their presence at meetings can promote integration and training.\n\n\nArticle 3: Territory or recruitment group \n\n\n(This section is optional.)\n\n\nAccording to the objectives of the cooperative, the recruitment may be limited.\nFor example, a cooperative that promotes local development will limit its\nmembership to its region or city. A cooperative may also be limited to members\nof a cultural community or women only.\n\n\nIt should however be careful that these criteria are not considered\ndiscriminatory (see Human Rights).\n\n\nArticle 4: Suspension or exclusion** \n\n\n(This section is optional.)\n\n\nThis article is excerpted from the law. By suspending or excluding members who,\nfor various reasons, have stopped working with the cooperative, it prevents\npeople who no longer participate in the life of the cooperative from unfairly\ninfluencing decisions or otherwise enjoying the benefits of membership. This\narticle must therefore be applied discriminately.\n\n\nThe law also provides a number of procedures for the suspension or expulsion of\na member.\n\n\nArticle 5: Suspension of voting rights \n\n\n(This section is optional.)\n\n\nA member who has little or done business with the cooperative may not be aware\nof the various problems being experienced by the cooperative. Thus, some\ncooperatives to ensure a maximum of expertise and relevance when taking votes,\nmay apply this provision of the law.\n\n\nThe membership contract should determine the cooperative's obligations to offer\nservices to its members.\n\n\nArticle 6: Sharing contracts \n\n\nThe regulation should minimally specify the grounds for the allocation of\ncontracts.\n\n\nOther relevant rules may be delegated to the board that will set a contract\nmanagement policy.\n\n\nBy law, a union must do business for over 50% of its service revenues with\nmembers. This article reinforces this obligation by prioritizing members versus\nnon-members.\n\n\nThis article limits the priority of the member if he does not respond in time\nto a call. It thus enables the cooperative to be more efficient in the\nallocation of contracts.\n\n\nArticle 7: Member Agreement \n\n\n(This section is optional.)\n\n\nThe member of contract is an agreement between the member and the cooperative\nfor a fixed or indefinite period, which recognizes the admission of the member\nin the cooperative.\n\n\nThe contract determines the nature of the relationship between the cooperative\nand the member.\n\n\nVarious elements can navigate: remuneration, contract distribution modalities,\nterms of payment of shares, etc.\n\n\nThe membership contract could also understand the expectations and demands on\nthe member: level of involvement, responsibilities, etc.\n\n\nIt is recommended to start with a relatively light contract that will evolve\nover time. (Annex III: Member Agreement)\n\n\nChapter V: Members Assembly \n\n\n(ref. Articles 63-79 of the Law)\n\n\nThe General Assembly of members is the highest decision making body of the\ncooperative. It elects the Board of Directors, adopts the regulations, rules on\nthe allocation of surplus and appoints the auditor. It has critical political\nand legal functions. It is particularly important that the convocation and\nholding follow specific procedures to avoid any confusion or misunderstanding.\nSome cooperatives (particularly those with significant membership) adopt a code\nof procedure known as the Morin code or the CSN code to hold their assemblies.\n\n\nArticle 1: General Assembly \n\n\nThis article confirms the Board of Directors' power to convene the General\nAssembly. However, the law allows members of the cooperative to convene an\nExtraordinary General Assembly.\n\n\nArticle 2: Remote participation \n\n\n(This section is optional)\n\n\nArticle 3: Notice of Meeting \n\n\nIn determining the rules of convocation, we make sure to avoid disputes and\nthus ensure the official nature of the decisions taken.\n\n\nThe notice must be in writing to members at least five days before the date\nfixed for the meeting.\n\n\nArticle 4: Annual General Assembly** \n\n\nRecall the rule prescribed by law (Article 76). The presence of this article in\nthe law may allow members to advise the Board if the meeting is not held in\ntime.\n\n\nArticle 5: Transmission of the Annual Report \n\n\n(This section is optional)\n\n\nArticle 6: Extraordinary General Assembly** \n\n\nAs Article 2 of this chapter, this article is a reminder of the rights of\nmembers. The extraordinary General Assembly (special general meeting) can be\ncalled by the board but it is important for members to know that they also have\nthat power.\n\n\nArticle 7: Quorum* \n\n\nA quorum is the minimum of members present to ensure that decisions taken at a\nmeeting to be valid. The law limits the quorum for a meeting with the members\npresent. However, it allows the settlement to include a stricter quorum.\n\n\nOne can, for example, putting a quorum by a majority of members of the\ncooperative or even two-thirds. The decision will depend on the number of\nmembers, political issues of the cooperative members and involvement of will.\nHowever, we must be careful not to make it ineffective governance structure of\nthe cooperative by imposing too high a quorum as this will prevent it from\nmaking valid decisions.\n\n\nIt should be noted that according to the law (Article 64), the quorum ceases to\napply after convening two successive meetings where there was no quorum. The\nsecond meeting may be held even if the quorum is not reached.\n\n\nArticle 8: Vote \n\n\nFor some delicate decisions, the members desire not to express their views\npublicly. For example, a person to vote against the interests of its work or\ncoordinating its partners could, if the vote is by show of hands, suffer the\nblow-cons in his working relationships. It is important to respect that right.\n\n\nArticle 9: Representation \n\n\nAn individual member can not physically be represented.\n\n\nChapter VI:  Board of Directors \n\n\n(ref. 80 Articles 106.1 and 223.2 of the Act)\n\n\nArticle 1: Eligibility of members* \n\n\n(This section is optional)\n\n\nBy law, the mere fact of being a member of the cooperative allows one to be\neligible for a position on the board. Since the members of the Board are\naccountable to the assembly and the law for the proper administration of the\ncooperative, their selection must be made, however rigorously. Other\neligibility criteria (allowed by law) may therefore be registered in the\nbylaws.\n\n\n\n\nBy setting a minimum transaction with the cooperative, ensures that the\n   candidate has sufficient experience in the cooperative to participate in its\n   administration.\n\n\nPayment in due form of qualifying shares demonstrates compliance with the\n   administrative procedure which is essential to a good administrator.\n   Maturities on qualifying shares are those who are late according to the\n   regulation.\n\n\n\n\nArticle 2: Eligibility of non-members* \n\n\n(This section is optional)\n\n\nSince 1997, members may elect persons who are not members of the cooperative to\npositions of directors. These positions, however, are limited to one third of\nthe total number of directorships. These candidates are usually resource\npersons or external investors. The law gives the council the power to recommend\nthe candidate to the Assembly.\n\n\nArticle 3: Observer membership* \n\n\n(This section is optional)\n\n\nIt is preferable that the cooperative provide in its regulations for the\napplication process to sit as observer. The request may be made orally or in\nwriting to the Board. It can also be decreed that such a request must be made\nat a special General Assembly.\n\n\nIt is good to also include the reasons for the request as an observer. A member\nmay be authorized to apply to sit as observer in case of doubt and suspicion of\nirregularities on the Board or simply for the purpose aiding the operation of\nthe Board in the context of possibly filling a director position.\n\n\nIt should also provide the conditions by which refusal is acceptable, for\nexample because of the confidential nature of the decisions required.\n\n\nArticle 4: Composition \n\n\nThe number of directors, including non-members, is a minimum of three and a\nmaximum of fifteen. An odd number is recommended to avoid ties in voting.\nHowever, in case of equality (if a member fails, for example) the chairman has\na casting vote 1. The board size is usually determined by the number of members\nof the cooperative. Other considerations such as the effectiveness of the board\nor the centralization of power (or de-centralization) are often among the items\ndiscussed.\n\n\nArticle 5: Powers of the Board \n\n\nWhile these powers are defined by law, it is pertinent to inform the members of\nthe powers of their boards.\n\n\nThe General Assembly may, by adopting a regulation to that effect, limit the\nauthority of the board. It is suggested not to abuse this power but only to\nensure that respect all members not be treated lightly by the board. The choice\nof such restrictions of Board power must take into account the efficiency of\noperations and the general will of the members.\n\n\nArticle 6: Duties of the Board** \n\n\nThe board's duties are drawn from the law. Their mention the internal bylaws\naims to inform members. Other duties may be given by the General Assembly.\n\n\nArticle 7: Director Tenure \n\n\nThis is the period for which the director is elected. The maximum duration is\nthree years. Directors whose term expires shall remain in office until they are\nreplaced or re-elected.\n\n\nIf no duration is indicated herein, the term is one year.\n\n\nArticle 7.1: Director Rotation \n\n\nThis is an operation through which, each year, some of the positions on the\nBoard are re-elected. For two-year terms, all posts have been put in election\nafter two years. For terms of three years, the rotation will be done over three\nyears. The first posts to be re-election are drawn. By this rotation mode, it\nallows the assembly to elect new directors every year and at the same time,\nensure better monitoring of records keeping a certain permanence to the Board.\nThe directors whose term expires may of course be re-elected. The Council will\nthen retain the same structure for the coming year.\n\n\nFor terms of one year, no rotation will be needed for all positions will be\nelected each year. The annual mandates allow the Assembly to renew the board\nmore regularly but this can create some instability if a large part or all of\nthe board is replaced.\n\n\nArticle 8: Nomination of non-member trustees \n\n\n(This section is optional)\n\n\nIf the General Assembly of the cooperative registered in the Regulations, or a\nnon-member directors can be elected.\n\n\nSections (1) and (3) are derived from the law while articles (2), (4) and (5)\noffer procedures.\n\n\nArticle 9: Nomination procedure and election of directors \n\n\nFor small cooperatives, it may not be possible to appoint a returning officer,\nan election clerk and two scrutineers, making it impossible to apply the usual\nelection procedure. Giving the option to choose a procedure avoids the problem.\nOne can, for example, appoint a secretary and a deputy Chairman, can nominate a\nblock team simple proposition, etc. It is suggested to prepare this alternative\nprocedure to save time meeting.\n\n\nArticle 9.1: Procedure \n\n\nThe presented procedure allows, if the number of members is sufficient, to\nensure the conduct of a transparent and democratic election.\n\n\nArticle 10: Board meetings \n\n\n** Written resolutions, signed by all directors have the same value in terms\nof the law as if they had been adopted during a meeting of the Board.\n\n\nThis article helps to avoid confusion and ensure the legal validity of\ndecisions taken in council meeting.\n\n\nWe suggest to hold meetings at a regular interval to ensure constant monitoring\nof the Board on the conduct of affairs of the cooperative.\n\n\nThe mode of meeting must be clear and effective. A reduced time for emergency\nmeetings allows greater speed of reaction. The law sets deadlines are five (5)\ndays. The members, however, may decide otherwise in the regulations.\n\n\nWritten resolutions, signed by all directors can be used for isolated and\nrelatively urgent issues that require debate.\n\n\nArticle 11: Revocation \n\n\nIt is important that members are aware of their right to dispose of directors.\nIt goes without saying that the use of the procedure under the law must be used\nin extreme cases.\n\n\nArticle 12: Holiday* \n\n\nTo ensure maximum expertise on the board, it is important not to leave seats\nvacant (due to resignation, dismissal or other). The board can therefore fill\nthe seat temporarily.\n\n\nChapter VII:  Executive Committee \n\n\n(ref. Articles 107-110 of the Act)\n\n\nArticle 1: Executive committee \n\n\n(This section is optional)\n\n\nNote: The constitution of such a committee is permitted only if the board\nconsists of at least 6 members.\n\n\nChapter VIII:  Leaders of the Cooperative \n\n\n(ref. Articles 112.1 and 117 of the Act)\n\n\nOnly the positions of President, Vice President and Secretary are prescribed by\nlaw. Others are created by regulation. These other items may be necessary\ndepending on the size of the cooperative or by the type of democracy desired by\nmembers.\n\n\nThe officers (president, vice-president, secretary, etc.) are appointed from\namong the directors (members of the board) who are elected in General Assembly.\n\n\nIn a small cooperative where decisions can be made quickly in the collective,\nit is less useful to centralize powers. Leaders may benefit from limited power\nefficiency without being affected.\n\n\nIn a larger cooperative, it is useful, sometimes even necessary, to better\ndefine the powers necessary to centralize and create more leadership positions.\nHowever, it is important that the distribution of powers is done according to a\nbalance of two elements: democracy and economic efficiency.\n\n\nCommittees may also be created by the Board of Directors to support specific\naspects of the cooperative financing, training, promotion, etc. Some standing\ncommittees can also be integrated in Regulation (executive committee, for\nexample).\n\n\nArticle 1: President \n\n\nThe president, in addition to her statutory role, usually has a leading\nfunction at associations. This is the person who should look after the\ninterests of members and that members could refer.\n\n\nArticle 2: Vice-president \n\n\nThe Vice President often has personal characteristics approximating those of\nthe president. He is also her right arm.\n\n\nArticle 3: Secretary-treasurer \n\n\n(this item may be split according to the number of directors to the board)\n\n\nThis position can also be split into two distinct positions. The size of the\ncooperative often influences the choice.\n\n\nThe secretary and treasurer are the only positions on the Board that may be\npaid for work related to the board since they are the only ones to produce work\nsuch as minutes or summaries of financial statements. They are, however, not\npaid for meetings. It should be noted that the secretary and the treasurer,\nbecause of the large amount of information processed, also involves a lot of\npower. It is therefore important to choose the right holders.\n\n\nArticle 4: CEO or manager or coordinator \n\n\n(This section is optional)\n\n\nOften the choice of the term reflects the ideology behind the post. Thus, a\nmanager or a general manager will often have a decision-making approach a\ncoordinator who will try to seek consensus and applies the collective\ndecisions. In all cases, it is responsible for the management of business\noperations. It is somehow complement or weight against the president.\n\n\nArticle 5: Development Advisor members \n\n\n(This section is optional)\n\n\nIt is interesting to include in the structure of the cooperative proceeding or\nrelated central role in community life and conflict regulations. This authority\nor person may be given a mediation role. Take care to appoint a person to that\nposition at the \"integrator\" profile with strong interpersonal skills.\n\n\nChapter IX:  Activities of the cooperative \n\n\n(ref. Articles 90, 226 and 128-134 of the Act)\n\n\nArticle 1: Workers compensation \n\n\nArticle 2: Continuing education \n\n\nArticle 3: Rebates, measuring the volume of work \n\n\nThe rate of rebates may vary depending on the nature or quality of products or\nservices which were the subject of operations. (Article 151)\n\n\nIn a cooperative, it is possible that members are awarded a portion of the\nsurplus (profits) of the company; they are called rebates. Unlike private\ncompanies, the amount of these rebates is not calculated according to the\namount invested but by the volume of operations carried out for the\ncooperative.\n\n\nThe working volume can be calculated from wages, hours worked or other method\nof calculation determined by regulation. It can also include volunteer hours to\npromote involvement.\n\n\nThe regulation may also determine that rebates are calculated to four years.\nThis measure enables members who have worked for the cooperative before it\ndeclares surplus to benefit more equitably sharing the surplus. These members\nare often the founders who have worked hard for the cooperative reaches\nprofitability. One can thus create a balance between the different generations\nof members: those who arrived after the stabilized and became profitable\ncooperative, and those who experienced the often very difficult start-up\nperiod. However, we must be concerned with the proportion that goes to old and\nnew. Be careful, for example, that the former does not monopolize almost all\ndiscounts in order not to discourage new.\n\n\nA cooperative may also prohibit the patronage allocation (it states in its\narticles of incorporation, box 5). In this case (if, in addition, it does not\npay interest on its share), it will be considered vis-\u00e0-vis the tax, as a\nnon-profit organization and will not have to pay for taxes on its surplus.\n\n\nArticle 4: Valuation Reserve \n\n\n(149.1 to 149.6 VIEW OF THE ACT)\n\n\nArticle 4.1: Constitution \n\n\nArticle 4.2: Overpayments and surplus \n\n\nArticle 4.3: Rebates \n\n\nArticle 4.4: Deficit \n\n\nArticle 4.5: Liquidation \n\n\nArticle 5: Suggestion and complaint \n\n\nWhile some cooperatives will leave to management the task of managing the\ncomplaints, others will form committees or adopt more detailed regulations.\nThis often depends on the size of the cooperative. However, it is important to\nhave a procedure to avoid arbitrariness.\n\n\nArticle 6: Insurance \n\n\nThe law and the most cooperative partners (financial institutions, landlords,\netc.) require the cooperative is ensured.\n\n\nArticle 7: Financial exercise \n\n\nThe financial year is often different from the calendar year (calendar). It\ndepends on the date of commencement of operations, the seasonal cycle (you may\nwant to close the year in a period less busy) or simultaneously with the fiscal\nyear (March 31).\n\n\nArticle 8: Signature \n\n\nFor added security, the law requires that more than one person signs the\nchecks. By having more signatories than the required number, you can get more\nflexibility (availability of signatory). Usually the director will signatory,\nas well as leaders on the board.\n\n\nArticle 9: Annual Report \n\n\nThe annual report is, above all, produced to give members information on the\ncooperative's operations during the year.\n\n\nArticle 10: Coming Into Force \n\n\nDate of adoption of the Regulation. You can also register each modification dates.",

If the cooperative does not\ndetermine such a process, the producer is a full member as of the first day for\nwhich he fulfills a mandate for the cooperative (unless otherwise specified by\nthe producer).  However, we strongly suggest setting up good integration processes, to ensure,\non the one hand, that new partners share the values and vision of the\norganization and on the other, that the person or entity understands the duties\nand responsibilities which become incumbent upon it as a member.  To formalize this new relationship between the producer and the cooperative, it\nis advisable to sign an application for admission as an auxiliary member -\nAPPENDIX 1.  This is to determine the time after which the board has enough information to\nproperly assess the admission of an auxiliary member as a permanent member. If\nyou want to keep a quality team, the selection of members should not be done\nlightly. However, excessively strict criteria involving a long and arduous\nselection process may result in alienating the person wishing to become a\nmember.  We must not forget that membership is an important factor of motivation. This\nmotivation is manifested in particular by an increased level of involvement in\nthe cooperative. So be careful not to unduly extend the evaluation period. This\ncould create an alienating effect in auxiliary members and a stagnant or even\ndecreasing involvement of these.  However, if one is looking for a very specific profile (high specialization,\nspecific values, etc.), it may be appropriate to set a longer probationary\nperiod and stricter criteria to ensure the highest quality member possible. The\nmaximum period permitted by law is 12 months (art 193.4).  If a minimum test period is planned, this may allow in some cases to speed up\nthe admissions process as a member, especially if the person is already well\nknown to the team.  In any case, a first associative evaluation could be systemized after the\nminimum period. If the auxiliary member meets the criteria of the coop,\nadministrators could accept immediately. Otherwise, the auxiliary member is\ninvited to continue the probationary period to its maximum term.  Other admission requirements may also be added: positive assessment of\nprofessional competence, level of voluntary involvement, etc. (Cooperatives\nAct, RSC., C. C-67.2., Article 3.1.

Unlike private\ncompanies, the amount of these rebates is not calculated according to the\namount invested but by the volume of operations carried out for the\ncooperative.  The working volume can be calculated from wages, hours worked or other method\nof calculation determined by regulation. It can also include volunteer hours to\npromote involvement.
