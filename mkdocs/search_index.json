The candidates concerned are then present for the recount;\n\n\nThe ballots are disposed of by the scrutineer immediately after the vote;\n\n\nAll decisions made by the chairman with regard to the procedure binds the assembly unless these members reverse them with a majority of the votes cast by the members present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6.

Term of office    The term of office of a director is three (3) years.  5.3.1. Director rotation     For the first three (3) years of the foundation of the cooperative, the term of office of the directors is as follows:  Two (2) positions will be up for election after the first year, two (2) positions after the second year and the last position after the third year.    A random draw will determine the positions that will be up for election after the first and second years.   The term of office of the directors elected afterward will be three (3) years.   5.4. Nomination of non-members directors     Nominations of non-members as directors are recommended at the Assembly by the board which has previously provided consent of such persons;   Each nomination must be approved by the Assembly;  After acceptance, if the number of candidates equals the number of vacant position, candidates are elected by acclamation;   If the number of accepted candidates exceeds the number of positions to be filled, there is an election in accordance with the election procedure;  If no nominations are accepted by the Assembly, it must fill the vacancy among the members of the cooperative.   5.5. Nomination and election of directors    The cooperative\u2019s president and secretary are election chairman and secretary, unless they are nominated:   The assembly names a scrutineer and, if need be, an election chairman and secretary.\n   By agreeing to act in this capacity, these persons also agree to not be nominated.  The chairman reads the names of the directors whose term haves ended.  Afterward, he informs the assembly of the following points:  The directors whose term is ending are eligible for reelection;  The members can nominate as many candidates as they wish;  The nominations are closed upon motion duly seconded and not contested;  The chairman verifies the acceptance of each candidate upon his nomination.\n   Any refusal automatically eliminates the candidate;  Afterward, if there are more candidates than vacancies, an election takes place.\n   If the number of candidates is equal to that of vacancies, the candidates are elected by acclamation; if the number of candidates is lower than that of vacancies, the board may fill the positions during the cooperative\u2019s fiscal year, in compliance with section  85  of the Act;  In the event of an election, the vote is by secret ballot. A ballot paper is given to each member, who then writes the name of the candidates of his choice. The number of names on the ballot must equal that of the vacancies;  The scrutineer adds up the votes obtained by each candidate and relays the outcome to the election chairman;   For each vacancy, the chairman declares elected the candidate who has received the most votes, without stating, however, the actual number of votes;   In case of equality of votes for the last vacancy, the vote is repeated only among the candidates with an equal number of votes;  If, after a second vote, the equality remains, the director is chosen by a random draw;  A recount of the votes is carried out if at least one third of the members present request it. The candidates concerned are then present for the recount;  The ballots are disposed of by the scrutineer immediately after the vote;  All decisions made by the chairman with regard to the procedure binds the assembly unless these members reverse them with a majority of the votes cast by the members present.     5.6. Board meetings    The board of directors meets as often as the cooperative\u2019s interest requires.  The notice is given by email at least five (5) days before the date of the meeting.  In the event of an emergency meeting, the time of notice is, exceptionally, reduced to twenty-four (24) hours.  The directors can use means of telecommunication to participate in meetings of the board if they are unable to do it physically.  All previous acts and motions carried at board meetings are deemed to be regular and valid even if it is subsequently discovered that the appointment of a director is tarnished by irregularities or that either one of the directors is not competent to be on the board.",

This is both\ntrue and false. While a cooperative is a company run democratically by\ntheoretically equal members, we often forget that there are many types of\ndemocracy: from direct democracy where everything is decided collectively, to\nthe other extreme of representative democracy, where most of the powers are\ncentralized with a manager and in which the members meet only once a year in a\ngeneral assembly. In between, we find different structures of division of\npowers. The more numerous and complex the decisions, the clearer the division\nof powers must be. Many decisions cannot be made arbitrarily by the leaders of\nthe cooperative; the members need to set rules to guide decisions regarding the\ngovernance of the cooperative.\n\n\nIt is therefore essential that a set of regulations adopted by the General\nAssembly guide managers in the management of the cooperative. In practice, the\nGeneral Assembly adopts internal by-laws at the founding of the cooperative and\nit alone has the power to change them later. We advise you to take particular\ncare in drafting these by-laws and especially that all members fully understand\nthem, because they form the foundation on which the whole democratic edifice of\nthe cooperative is built. The internal by-laws must also be seen as a didactic\ntool. It not only allows members to better understand certain characteristics\nof their cooperative but can also be used to inform members of some of their\nrights. It may therefore be appropriate to include some general information\nthat is not necessarily specific to the cooperative concerned. For example, the\nacceptable delay for calling an annual general meeting after the end of the\nfiscal year or the rules of convening an extraordinary general meeting.\nAlthough these components are based on law, we recommend integrating them into\ninternal by-laws. This information may be useful for members who, for the most\npart, will not be inclined to consult the law.\n\n\nIt is important to understand that the internal by-laws are a living document\nthat must adapt to the evolution of the cooperative. One can also add to it, as\nnecessary, other regulations or appendices such as a labor agreement,\ndisciplinary rules, a member of contract, etc. In most cases, the regulations\nwill be adapted and modified several times during the early years of the\ncooperative. In its first version, the internal by-laws should therefore not be\ntoo comprehensive and detailed, so as not to tie the hands of the directors and\nmanagement in unexpected situations. These are often the experiences that will\nhelp to identify additional items that should be incorporated into the by-laws.\nWhile detailed regulations give more guidance to leaders and managers, they\nalso limit their discretion to act as appropriate.

Definitions\n \n\n\nBasic definitions help avoid confusion in the interpretation of articles of the by-laws. We should strive to clearly define the most frequently used terms and all terms in the by-laws whose meaning may vary from one context or person to another.\n\n\nChapter II: Capital Stock\n \n\n\n(ref. Sections \n37\n-\n49\n of the Law)\n\n\n2.1. Qualifying shares\n \n\n\nNote: The number of qualifying shares may vary according to the nature of operations in which the member participates and by service volume that the cooperative is able to offer the member.\n\n\nThis is to determine the minimum level of financial commitment required to obtain membership status; that is to say the minimum amount to invest to become a member. This financial involvement has two functions: to consolidate the membership of the member in the cooperative (\"I've invested, I want it to work\") and increase the company's capitalization and, in doing so, the available liquidity the cooperative.\n\n\nQualifying shares may be of two types: only common shares or common shares and preferred shares. It is recommended that the minimum common shares ($10.00) and the rest in preferred shares since the latter are eligible for significant tax advantages and may bear interest (this interest should be limited), which is not the case for the common shares.\n\n\nCommon share represents one's engagement in the co-op, granting the right to be notified of general assemblies, vote at such meetings, etc. Preferred shares represent an investment in the co-op, but don't grant such rights; ref: \nSection 49\n of the Law.\n\n\n2.2. Payment terms\n \n\n\nWe distinguish between the purchase price of the shares, and an acceptable payment schedule. The minimum qualifying investment is currently set at $500, but we allow a couple payment options, so as not to unnecessarily burden new members' cashflows.\n\n\nQualifying shares may be paid in several ways: in full upon admission to membership or fixed payments. Although full payment upon admission proves a real commitment to the cooperative, requiring it could limit the admission of interesting candidates who do not have the necessary funds. \n\n\n2.3. Transfer of shares\n \n\n\nPreferred shares are transferable under the conditions set by the Board in accordance with \nSection 46\n of the Law.\n\n\n2.4. Reimbursement of shares\n \n\n\nReimbursement of shares is done upon departure of a member, but the board may determine priorities among the items listed in the law.\n\n\n2.5. Preferred shares\n \n\n\nThe board determines the amount, privileges, rights and restrictions of the shares and the conditions of their redemption, repayment or transfer. \n\n\nThe Cooperative Department provides a template for Board resolutions. This template is made based on the eligibility of preferred shares to the Cooperative Investment Plan (CIP), which provides a tax deduction of up to 125% to the cooperative members or workers who invest in preferred shares.\n\n\n2.6. Reimbursement of preferred shares\n \n\n\nSubject to the restrictions provided for in \nSection 38\n of the Act, the preferred shares are redeemable or redeemable under the conditions set by the Board in accordance with \nSection 46\n of the Act.\n\n\nThe Board may establish rules in this area. However, if members wish to use CIP, the board has to stick to the framework provided by the Cooperative Department, which sets the rules of redemption and repayment.\n\n\nThe date of 14 February 1997, cited in the law, refers to the old law which required that these rules are subject to a regulation adopted in General Assembly.\n\n\nThe Board may provide conditions of refund based on priority classes. It is thus necessary to distinguish the origin of the shares. Those from staff member investments could be repaid in priority, those from the payment of a dividend could be reimbursed next.\n\n\nChapter III: Members\n \n\n\n(Reference: sections \n51\n to \n60.2\n, \n224.1\n and \n224.2\n of the Act)\n\n\n3.1. Admission as a member\n \n\n\nThe law does not require the cooperative to implement a process of integration of members through the auxiliary member status. If the cooperative does not determine such a process, the producer is a full member as of the first day for which he fulfills a mandate for the cooperative (unless otherwise specified by the producer).\n\n\nHowever, we strongly suggest setting up good integration processes, to ensure, on the one hand, that new partners share the values and vision of the organization and on the other, that the person or entity understands the duties and responsibilities which become incumbent upon it as a member.\n\n\n3.2. Admission as an auxiliary member\n \n\n\nTo formalize this new relationship between the producer and the cooperative, it is advisable to sign an application for admission as an auxiliary member - APPENDIX 1.\n\n\nThis is to determine the time after which the board has enough information to properly assess the admission of an auxiliary member as a permanent member. If you want to keep a quality team, the selection of members should not be done lightly. However, excessively strict criteria involving a long and arduous selection process may result in alienating the person wishing to become a member.\n\n\nWe must not forget that membership is an important factor of motivation. This motivation is manifested in particular by an increased level of involvement in the cooperative. So be careful not to unduly extend the evaluation period. This could create an alienating effect in auxiliary members and a stagnant or even decreasing involvement of these.\n\n\nHowever, if one is looking for a very specific profile (high specialization, specific values, etc.), it may be appropriate to set a longer probationary period and stricter criteria to ensure the highest quality member possible. The maximum period permitted by law is 12 months (art 193.4).\n\n\nIf a minimum test period is planned, this may allow in some cases to speed up the admissions process as a member, especially if the person is already well known to the team.\n\n\nIn any case, a first associative evaluation could be systemized after the minimum period. If the auxiliary member meets the criteria of the coop, administrators could accept immediately. Otherwise, the auxiliary member is invited to continue the probationary period to its maximum term.\n\n\nOther admission requirements may also be added: positive assessment of professional competence, level of voluntary involvement, etc. (Cooperatives Act, RSC., C. C-67.2., Article 3.1. C)\n\n\nThe cooperative may establish additional conditions for admission.\n\n\n3.3. Rights of auxiliary members\n \n\n\n(This section is optional.)\n\n\nThere is no requirement for a cooperative to convoke auxiliary members.\nHowever, their presence at meetings can promote integration and training.\n\n\nChapter IV: Members Assembly\n \n\n\n(Reference: Sections \n63\n to \n79\n of the Law)\n\n\nThe General Assembly of members is the highest decision making body of the\ncooperative. It elects the Board of Directors, adopts the regulations, rules on\nthe allocation of surplus and appoints the auditor. It has critical political\nand legal functions. It is particularly important that the convocation and\nholding follow specific procedures to avoid any confusion or misunderstanding.\nSome cooperatives (particularly those with significant membership) adopt a code\nof procedure known as the Morin code or the CSN code to hold their assemblies.\n\n\n4.1. General Assembly\n \n\n\nThis article confirms the Board of Directors' power to convene the General\nAssembly. However, the law allows members of the cooperative to convene an\nExtraordinary General Assembly.\n\n\n4.2. Notice of Meeting\n \n\n\nIn determining the rules of convocation, we make sure to avoid disputes and\nthus ensure the official nature of the decisions taken.\n\n\nThe notice must be in writing to members at least five days before the date\nfixed for the meeting.\n\n\n4.3. Remote participation\n \n\n\n(This section is optional)\n\n\n4.4. Vote\n \n\n\nFor some delicate decisions, the members desire not to express their views\npublicly. For example, a person to vote against the interests of its work or\ncoordinating its partners could, if the vote is by show of hands, suffer the\nblow-cons in his working relationships. It is important to respect that right.\n\n\nChapter V: Board of Directors \n\n\n(Reference: sections \n80\n to \n106.1\n and \n223.2\n of the Act)\n\n\n5.1. Eligibility of members\n \n\n\n(This section is optional)\n\n\nBy law, the mere fact of being a member of the cooperative allows one to be\neligible for a position on the board. Since the members of the Board are\naccountable to the assembly and the law for the proper administration of the\ncooperative, their selection must be made, however rigorously. Other\neligibility criteria (allowed by law) may therefore be registered in the\nbylaws.\n\n\n\n\nBy setting a minimum transaction with the cooperative, ensures that the\n   candidate has sufficient experience in the cooperative to participate in its\n   administration.\n\n\nPayment in due form of qualifying shares demonstrates compliance with the\n   administrative procedure which is essential to a good administrator.\n   Maturities on qualifying shares are those who are late according to the\n   regulation.\n\n\n\n\n5.2. Composition\n \n\n\nThe number of directors, including non-members, is a minimum of three and a\nmaximum of fifteen. An odd number is recommended to avoid ties in voting.\nHowever, in case of equality (if a member fails, for example) the chairman has\na casting vote 1. The board size is usually determined by the number of members\nof the cooperative. Other considerations such as the effectiveness of the board\nor the centralization of power (or de-centralization) are often among the items\ndiscussed.\n\n\n5.3. Term of office\n \n\n\nThis is the period for which the director is elected. The maximum duration is\nthree years. Directors whose term expires shall remain in office until they are\nreplaced or re-elected.\n\n\nIf no duration is indicated herein, the term is one year.\n\n\n5.3.1. Director rotation\n \n\n\nThis is an operation through which, each year, some of the positions on the\nBoard are re-elected. For two-year terms, all posts have been put in election\nafter two years. For terms of three years, the rotation will be done over three\nyears. The first posts to be re-election are drawn. By this rotation mode, it\nallows the assembly to elect new directors every year and at the same time,\nensure better monitoring of records keeping a certain permanence to the Board.\nThe directors whose term expires may of course be re-elected. The Council will\nthen retain the same structure for the coming year.\n\n\nFor terms of one year, no rotation will be needed for all positions will be\nelected each year. The annual mandates allow the Assembly to renew the board\nmore regularly but this can create some instability if a large part or all of\nthe board is replaced.\n\n\n5.4. Nomination of non-members directors\n \n\n\n(This section is optional)\n\n\nIf the General Assembly of the cooperative registered in the Regulations, or a\nnon-member directors can be elected.\n\n\nSections (1) and (3) are derived from the law while articles (2), (4) and (5)\noffer procedures.\n\n\n5.5. Nomination and election of directors\n \n\n\nFor small cooperatives, it may not be possible to appoint a returning officer,\nan election clerk and two scrutineers, making it impossible to apply the usual\nelection procedure. Giving the option to choose a procedure avoids the problem.\nOne can, for example, appoint a secretary and a deputy Chairman, can nominate a\nblock team simple proposition, etc. It is suggested to prepare this alternative\nprocedure to save time meeting.\n\n\nThe presented procedure allows, if the number of members is sufficient, to\nensure the conduct of a transparent and democratic election.\n\n\n5.6. Board meetings\n \n\n\nWritten resolutions, signed by all directors have the same value in terms\nof the law as if they had been adopted during a meeting of the Board.\n\n\nThis article helps to avoid confusion and ensure the legal validity of\ndecisions taken in council meeting.\n\n\nWe suggest to hold meetings at a regular interval to ensure constant monitoring\nof the Board on the conduct of affairs of the cooperative.\n\n\nThe mode of meeting must be clear and effective. A reduced time for emergency\nmeetings allows greater speed of reaction. The law sets deadlines are five (5)\ndays. The members, however, may decide otherwise in the regulations.\n\n\nWritten resolutions, signed by all directors can be used for isolated and\nrelatively urgent issues that require debate.\n\n\nChapter VI: Powers and Duties of the Cooperative\u2019s Officers\n \n\n\n(Reference: sections \n112.1\n and \n117\n of the Act)\n\n\nOnly the positions of President, Vice President and Secretary are prescribed by\nlaw. Others are created by regulation. These other items may be necessary\ndepending on the size of the cooperative or by the type of democracy desired by\nmembers.\n\n\nThe officers (president, vice-president, secretary, etc.) are appointed from\namong the directors (members of the board) who are elected in General Assembly.\n\n\nIn a small cooperative where decisions can be made quickly in the collective,\nit is less useful to centralize powers. Leaders may benefit from limited power\nefficiency without being affected.\n\n\nIn a larger cooperative, it is useful, sometimes even necessary, to better\ndefine the powers necessary to centralize and create more leadership positions.\nHowever, it is important that the distribution of powers is done according to a\nbalance of two elements: democracy and economic efficiency.\n\n\nCommittees may also be created by the Board of Directors to support specific\naspects of the cooperative financing, training, promotion, etc. Some standing\ncommittees can also be integrated in Regulation (executive committee, for\nexample).\n\n\n6.1. President\n \n\n\nThe president, in addition to her statutory role, usually has a leading\nfunction at associations. This is the person who should look after the\ninterests of members and that members could refer.\n\n\n6.2. Vice-president\n \n\n\nThe Vice President often has personal characteristics approximating those of\nthe president. He is also her right arm.\n\n\n6.3. Secretary\n \n\n\nThe secretary and treasurer are the only positions on the Board that may be\npaid for work related to the board since they are the only ones to produce work\nsuch as minutes or summaries of financial statements. They are, however, not\npaid for meetings. It should be noted that the secretary and the treasurer,\nbecause of the large amount of information processed, also involves a lot of\npower. It is therefore important to choose the right holders.\n\n\n6.4. Treasurer\n \n\n\n6.5. General Manager\n \n\n\n(This section is optional)\n\n\nOften the choice of the term reflects the ideology behind the post. Thus, a\nmanager or a general manager will often have a decision-making approach a\ncoordinator who will try to seek consensus and applies the collective\ndecisions. In all cases, it is responsible for the management of business\noperations. It is somehow complement or weight against the president.\n\n\nChapter VII: Activities\n \n\n\n(Reference: sections \n90\n, \n226\n and \n128\n-\n134\n of the Act)\n\n\n7.1. Insurance\n \n\n\nThe law and the most cooperative partners (financial institutions, landlords,\netc.) require the cooperative is ensured.\n\n\n7.2. Fiscal year\n \n\n\nThe financial year is often different from the calendar year (calendar). It\ndepends on the date of commencement of operations, the seasonal cycle (you may\nwant to close the year in a period less busy) or simultaneously with the fiscal\nyear (March 31).\n\n\n7.3 Effective date\n \n\n\nDate of adoption of the Regulation. You can also register each modification dates.",

These other items may be necessary\ndepending on the size of the cooperative or by the type of democracy desired by\nmembers.  The officers (president, vice-president, secretary, etc.) are appointed from\namong the directors (members of the board) who are elected in General Assembly.  In a small cooperative where decisions can be made quickly in the collective,\nit is less useful to centralize powers. Leaders may benefit from limited power\nefficiency without being affected.  In a larger cooperative, it is useful, sometimes even necessary, to better\ndefine the powers necessary to centralize and create more leadership positions.\nHowever, it is important that the distribution of powers is done according to a\nbalance of two elements: democracy and economic efficiency.  Committees may also be created by the Board of Directors to support specific\naspects of the cooperative financing, training, promotion, etc. Some standing\ncommittees can also be integrated in Regulation (executive committee, for\nexample).  6.1. President    The president, in addition to her statutory role, usually has a leading\nfunction at associations. This is the person who should look after the\ninterests of members and that members could refer.  6.2. Vice-president    The Vice President often has personal characteristics approximating those of\nthe president. He is also her right arm.  6.3. Secretary    The secretary and treasurer are the only positions on the Board that may be\npaid for work related to the board since they are the only ones to produce work\nsuch as minutes or summaries of financial statements. They are, however, not\npaid for meetings. It should be noted that the secretary and the treasurer,\nbecause of the large amount of information processed, also involves a lot of\npower. It is therefore important to choose the right holders.  6.4. Treasurer    6.5. General Manager    (This section is optional)  Often the choice of the term reflects the ideology behind the post. Thus, a\nmanager or a general manager will often have a decision-making approach a\ncoordinator who will try to seek consensus and applies the collective\ndecisions. In all cases, it is responsible for the management of business\noperations. It is somehow complement or weight against the president.",

Legal Remedy\n\n\nIn the event that the Recipient shall breach this Agreement, or in the event that a breach appears to be imminent, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to all legal and equitable remedies afforded it by law, and in addition may recover all reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred in seeking such remedies.  If the Confidential Information is sought by any third party, including by way of subpoena or other court process, the Recipient shall inform the Disclosing Party of the request in sufficient time to permit the Disclosing Party to object to and, if necessary, seek court intervention to prevent the disclosure.\n\n\n6.
