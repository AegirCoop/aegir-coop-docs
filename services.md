Ã†gir Cooperative Service Offerings
==================================

The Co-op's services currently fall under two categories:

* [Support](/services/support.md)
* [Training](/services/training.md)


Excluded Services
-----------------

There are a couple services that we have specifically decided **not** to provide:

* Aegir consulting
* Aegir hosting

Our reasoning here is that we want to help to build a thriving eco-system for Aegir. By providing the above services, we would be competing against other participants in the eco-system, rather than supporting them.
