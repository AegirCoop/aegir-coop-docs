Ægir Cooperative Governance
===========================

Governance refers to the mechanisms, processes and relations by which the Ægir Cooperative is controlled and directed. Our governance structures and principles specify the distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants in the cooperative (such as the Board of Directors, members, and other stakeholders) and includes the rules and procedures for making decisions in Cooperative affairs.

Governance includes the processes through which the Cooperative's objectives are set and pursued. Governance mechanisms include monitoring the actions, policies, practices, and decisions of the cooperative, our members, agents, and affected stakeholders. These practices are intended to align the interests of stakeholders, particularly in relation to accountability.

This section includes:

* The Ægir Cooperative's [By-laws](governance/by-laws.md)
* The Co-op's public-facing [policies](governance/policies.md)
* Templates for [standard contracts](governance/contracts.md)
* [Procedures](governance/procedures.md) for distributed decision-making
