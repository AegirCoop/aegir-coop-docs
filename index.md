Aegir Cooperative
=================

The Aegir Cooperative provides “vendor” support for the [Aegir Hosting System](http://docs.aegirproject.org). We are the Aegir Project’s core developers and maintainers, as well as community contributors and other experts. Our goals are two-fold:

* Provide reliable, affordable support for the Aegir Hosting System; and
* Finance on-going maintenance and development of Aegir and related projects.

We aim to give peace-of-mind to users who choose Free Software to run their own web infrastructure. Hence our motto:

> You host. We support.

We are currently in the final phases of formalizing the cooperative, and will be launching our initial service offerings shortly.

Because we believe in full transparency, this site hosts documentation related to the Aegir Cooperative. It contains the following sections:

* [Operations Manual](operations.md)
* [Governance](governance.md)
